I am a self-taught frontend developer and only started coding at the start of this year. I chanced upon the Magic Eden Creator Moetization Hackathon and thought it was a great opportunity to grow my skills and also dive deep into the web3 developer world.

Liberty Royalty Tracking Tool allows anyone to check if royalty payments have been made with each transaction. The goal in mind when starting this project was to create a "NFT royalty tracking explorer" if you will. Of course, there are still many more feature to be implemented but the main functionality of this project has been created and I will only progress to make it better.

Use Cases: 
* For future NFT creators or current to check which marketplace with the highest royalty fulfillment rate
* Check what percentage of their NFT transaction has royalties paid
* Check individual transactions for details of seller


### Built With

-- Beta Version --
* HTML
* Javascript

-- Future --
* React.js

### Installation

1. Get a free API Key at [https://dev.helius.xyz/](https://dev.helius.xyz/)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Reenadivya/Liberty-magiceden.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `app.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

At this point in time users have to enter the transaction Id of the NFT sale for that collection and information such as, source of sale, description, buyer, seller and if the royalty was paid or not woudl be declared on the page. 

In the future, further query parameteres such as searching a whole NFT collection and checking the percenatge of royalties paid on each transaction would be available.
   
   
<!-- FUTURE -->
## Roadmap

- Create functionality with HTML and Javascript
- Move code to React web application
- Host on Official Website
- Discord integration to block utilites of given NFT
- Temporailry altering metadata of NFT image of unpaid royalty transactions
